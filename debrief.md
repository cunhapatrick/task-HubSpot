# Short Debrief: Code Improvements
- The code could be refactored to follow the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** by separating functions into dedicated modules and adopting a proper design system such as **Layered Architecture** to organize business logic, data access, and API integrations.
- Global variables like `expirationDate` should be encapsulated in **state managers** for better control and consistency.  
- Tasks such as `processContacts` and `processCompanies` can run in parallel using `Promise.all` to **reduce execution time**.  
- A centralized **error-handling middleware** would make the code cleaner and more efficient.  
- Implementing **caching** for frequently processed data would minimize repetitive API calls to HubSpot.  
- Migrating to **TypeScript** would enhance code safety with static typing and better tooling.  
- Structured logs in **JSON format** would improve debugging and system monitoring.  
- Adopting **linting and formatting tools** like ESLint and Prettier would ensure code consistency and readability.
